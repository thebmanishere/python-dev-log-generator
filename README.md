# What is this? 

At my current devjob, I'm mainly working with python for our backend systems. At the end of each week, I'm tasked with creating a dev log to keep a record of what was accomplished during the work week. So I came up with the idea to try and streamline the process by building my own log generator. The main idea was to try and cut down on the tedium, while sharpening my python skillset and learning a GUI library for web apps. 

Overall the project took about a week and a half to build. This was a fun opportunity to step outside of my comfort zone and learn something new.
